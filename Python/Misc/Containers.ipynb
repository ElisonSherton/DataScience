    "hhhmmmm... Not what I expected. This is the result of the generator producing the results a single time. The above generator has raised a `StopIteration` by reaching the end of the file and you won't get any more results when attempting to iterate over it again. What's more confusing is that no error has been raised either. This is because iterators such as `for` loops or the `list` constructor used above expect a `StopIteration` to be raised during normal operation. These functions cannot tell the difference between an iterator with no data or an iterator that has exhausted its output."

    "So how can we get around this problem? We could just store the first result but that could take up large amount of memory and cause the program to crash, so we probably don't want to do that. We can create an iterable container by defining a `__iter__` special method. The special `__iter__` method is used to define a way to iterate over data, in this case we are using it to iterate through a file. Internally, the `__iter__` returns an iterator object, which itself calls the `__next__` method. The iterator object will continue to call the `__next__` method until a `StopIteration` is raised. Below is an example container to iterate over a file given its path. We can call the `__iter__` method by simply iterating over an instance of the class e.g `for i in ReadFile('example.txt'):`"
